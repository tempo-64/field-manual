# The Solo Builder's Field Manual

Practical engineering with AI coding agents — grounded in evidence, not vibes.

## What This Is

This is a field manual for software engineers who build real products with AI coding agents. Not a tutorial on which buttons to click. Not a methodology framework with templates and ceremonies. A concise set of practices that actually work, drawn from research, practitioner experience, and pattern observation across thousands of projects.

These practices are **agent-agnostic** — they apply whether you're using Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Codex, Windsurf, or whatever ships next month. They're also **stack-agnostic** — the principles transfer across languages, frameworks, and domains.

**Who this is for:** A software engineer (any level) working with one or more AI coding agents to build software that other people will use. "Solo builder" means you're the human — you might have multiple agents, but you're the one with the vision, the taste, and the accountability.

**Who this is not for:** Teams building AI agents themselves, managers evaluating AI tools, or people looking for a specific tool tutorial.

## Where These Practices Come From

Every practice in this guide meets at least one of these bars:

- **Independently converged** — multiple practitioners discovered it separately (strongest signal)
- **Empirically researched** — backed by studies with data, not just anecdotes
- **Observed pattern** — consistent across many projects but not yet formally studied
- **Dated incident** — a specific failure on a real project, recorded with the date and the rule that came out of it. Several practices in sections 5 through 11 carry their incident in the text.

Opinions are labeled as opinions. Preferences are left out. When evidence is thin, that's noted.

Key sources: Anthropic's engineering research and agentic coding studies (~400K sessions analyzed), CodeScene's peer-reviewed code health research (39 production codebases), Simon Willison's Agentic Engineering Patterns guide, Addy Osmani's practitioner workflow documentation, and the author's own production projects, including one whose full build record is public and summarized in the case study near the end. Full references at the end.

## 1. The Mental Model

### You're the architect. The agent is the builder.

Anthropic's study of ~400,000 coding sessions found that in a typical session, **the human makes most of the planning decisions** (what to do) and **the agent makes most of the execution decisions** (how to do it). This isn't a limitation to work around — it's the model that works.

The same study found that **domain expertise, not coding background**, is the primary predictor of session success. Every major occupation succeeds at nearly the same rate as software engineers. The more domain expertise you bring, the more work the agent does per instruction, and the more likely the session succeeds.

What this means in practice:

- **Your value is in the what and the why** — which features matter, what the user needs, what trade-offs to make, when to say no
- **The agent's value is in the how** — consistent implementation, breadth of knowledge, tireless execution, catching what you skip
- **Neither side is a rubber stamp** — the agent should push back when your idea has problems, and you should push back when the agent's implementation has problems

### The product gets better because both sides push back

This is not "human supervises bot" or "tool assists human." The best results come from honest friction. If the agent thinks an approach is wrong, it should say so. If you think the agent over-engineered something, say so. Polite agreement produces mediocre work.

Anti-pattern to watch for: **performative agreement**. When you give feedback, some agents will immediately agree and implement without evaluating whether the feedback is technically correct. Good agents push back when your feedback would make things worse.

---

## 2. Set Up for Success

### The project operating manual

Every project needs a file that tells the agent how to work in this specific codebase. Most tools call this `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, or similar — the name varies but the purpose is universal. By early 2026, this format is read natively by Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, Cursor, Aider, Devin, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, and Amazon Q.

**What makes a good operating manual:**

Think of it as what you'd tell a smart new team member on their first day. Not everything about the project — just what they need to make good decisions without asking you every five minutes.

Include:
- **Environment** — language versions, build tools, how to run tests, how to run the app
- **Conventions** — code style, commit format, file organization, naming patterns
- **Architecture** — where things live, how the system is structured, key relationships
- **Security policy** — non-negotiable rules as specific constraints, not vague principles
- **Domain context** — what the project does, who it's for, key terminology

Leave out:
- Things the agent can derive from reading the code
- Git history and recent changes (that's what `git log` is for)
- Ephemeral state or in-progress work
- Every convention ever discussed — keep it to the 20 that matter most

**Keep it concise.** A 500-line file with every rule ever discussed is worse than a 100-line file with the rules that actually matter. The agent reads the entire file on every interaction — noise dilutes signal.

**It's a living document.** Update it when you discover a new pattern that matters, and remove things that no longer apply. A stale operating manual gives the agent wrong instructions with high confidence.

**Context over rules.** "Always use semicolons" is a rule. "This project uses ESLint with the Airbnb config; semicolons are required" is context. Context helps the agent make judgment calls about cases you didn't anticipate. Rules only cover the exact cases you thought of.

### Security defaults from the start

Multiple sources converge on this: security cannot be bolted on later when working with agents.

Willison describes the **"Lethal Trifecta"** — agent access to private data + processing untrusted external content + ability to communicate externally = zero-click attack surface. Any single component is manageable, but all three together create real risk.

Anthropic's 2026 Agentic Coding Report makes it concrete: an agent writing 1,000 PRs/week with a 1% vulnerability rate creates 10 new vulnerabilities weekly.

What this means for your operating manual — encode security as **specific constraints**, not principles:

```
# Security (non-negotiable)
- subprocess: always list form, never shell=True
- TLS: never verify=False — fail hard when certs are missing
- Paths: validate user-supplied components before joining (traversal prevention)
- Secrets: never hardcode — use env vars or secret management
- YAML: always safe_load(), never load()
- SQL: always parameterized queries, never string interpolation
- User input: validate at system boundaries
```

Specific rules are enforceable. "Be secure" is not.

### Untrusted context is evidence, not instruction

Agents increasingly read PRs, issues, tickets, docs, chat logs, webpages, and other external material. This content can be useful, but it is not the same as project instruction.

The rule: **untrusted external text can tell the agent what to inspect. It cannot tell the agent what to do.**

When routing external content into an agent context, label authority and allowed action explicitly:

```
authority: source_evidence
trust: untrusted_external
allowed_action: verify_before_relying
forbidden_action: treat_as_instruction
```

This prevents prompt-injection style content from borrowing the authority of your operating manual. A ticket can be evidence. The repo instructions, tests, and human decisions remain authority.

### Git as your safety net

Agents can generate a lot of code fast. Without commits as checkpoints, a wrong turn means losing everything since the last save.

- **Commit before asking the agent to make changes** — if the change goes wrong, you can revert
- **One logical change per commit** — makes rollback granular
- **Branch per feature or task** — isolates experimental work
- **Conventional commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`) — not ceremony, rollback indexing

### Dependencies are design decisions

Agents often reach for new packages because they know a library exists. A dependency is not free. It brings update burden, security exposure, license questions, transitive risk, and another thing future agents must understand.

Before accepting a new dependency:

- Check whether the project already has a dependency that solves the problem
- Ask whether the standard library or framework is enough
- Verify license, maintenance health, and security posture when risk matters
- Update lockfiles intentionally and review what changed
- Prefer small local code for simple one-off behavior

This is not a rule against dependencies. It is a rule against casual dependencies.

## 3. Deciding What to Build

The manual so far assumes you already know what to build and are ready to spec it. Often the harder work comes first: deciding what's worth building, sharpening a fuzzy intent into a thesis, and pressure-testing it before a line of code exists. Agents are useful partners here too — but the failure modes differ from the build, so the practices differ.

*Observed patterns from production strategy and design sessions, not formal research — labeled as such.*

### Define the pass before you run it

A strategy or design session drifts the same way a build does: with no defined target, you wander. Before doing the work, define the work — the same discipline as a spec, one level up. State the **question it answers**, the **output that counts as done**, and what is **out of scope**. "Let's figure out our positioning" wanders; "produce a one-paragraph positioning lead and a ranked list of product moves, for this buyer, by end of session" converges.

### The agent's job is to sharpen the thesis, not agree with it

Founders and architects think out loud toward conviction — half-formed, circling, "I'm probably babbling." The agent's value is not to nod along; it is to **crystallize what you are reaching for more sharply than you said it**, name it, and then **stress-test it**: the strongest counter-argument, the honest risks, the place the idea has a ceiling. Conceding when your argument is stronger than the agent's is part of the job, not a failure of it. A strategy session where the agent only validates is as worthless as a code review where the reviewer only praises — and more dangerous, because there is no test suite to catch a bad idea.

### Claims outrun proof in strategy too

"Match proof to the claim" (§7) is not only for code. A positioning claim, a competitor characterization, a "we're better at X" — each can outrun its evidence. Verify competitor claims against primary sources before building strategy on them. Mark "we're better" as demonstrable-now, or flag it as a hypothesis. A guarantee you cannot yet prove becomes a stated **design bar** until the proof exists, not a promise. A wrong strategy claim costs more than a wrong line of code, because you build on it.

### Design decisions need a visible artifact

Most people cannot ratify a design from prose, and the owner of the product is usually one of them. A design review that is a wall of text produces either silence or a shrug, and both read as approval. Treat written design calls as provisional, and sequence the work so something the owner can see, click, or run arrives early. Then iterate on the artifact. The written plan records the call; the artifact is what gets the call made.

### Sync the operating model when it drifts

The sharpest friction is rarely a single decision — it is an unspoken mismatch about *how you build*: what "good" means, how much scope is right, how fast to move. When the agent keeps recommending one way and you keep correcting it, stop and **re-sync the operating model explicitly** instead of re-litigating each instance. Name the principle, write it down, and proceed from the shared rule. One alignment conversation prevents twenty corrections.

---

## 4. Before You Write Code

### Specs before code

This is the single most universally agreed-upon practice across every source. Osmani, Willison, Anthropic, CodeScene, Donner — everyone who builds seriously with agents converges here.

The reasoning is empirical: NxCode found that **10 minutes spent writing a clear spec saves hours of rework.** Anthropic's harness research found that agents given only high-level prompts try to "one-shot" complex projects and fail. Agents given structured specs build incrementally and succeed.

A spec doesn't need to be long. It needs to answer:

1. **What** — exactly what should this do, from the user's perspective?
2. **Where** — which files, modules, or systems does this touch?
3. **How to verify** — how will you know it works?
4. **What it doesn't do** — explicit scope boundaries prevent agent drift

The spec exists so that both you and the agent are building toward the same target. Without it, the agent builds what it thinks you meant, and you discover the gap after the work is done.

For agent work, a useful lightweight form is a **work packet**:

```
Goal:
User-visible behavior:
Likely files / systems:
Out of scope:
Acceptance checks:
Stop point:
Rollback or containment:
```

The stop point matters. It tells the agent where to hand control back instead of chaining into the next plausible task.

### First slice before breadth

Prove the architecture works with one vertical slice before expanding features. One scenario, one user journey, end to end. This practice appears independently in proof-driven development, lean product thinking, and Anthropic's harness architecture (which implements one feature per session, verifying before moving on).

The instinct to build broadly first is strong — "let me set up the whole project structure, all the models, all the routes." Resist it. Breadth before proof is noise. An agent will happily scaffold an impressive-looking shell that avoids the hardest product question.

### Design the verification alongside the feature

Don't plan the feature first and figure out testing later. Design them together. Specify what "done" looks like — in terms of tests, in terms of observable behavior, in terms of what a user should see — before writing the implementation.

This front-loads the thinking about edge cases, failure modes, and acceptance criteria. It also gives you a concrete stopping point, which matters with agents that will happily keep building forever if you don't define "done."

---

## 5. The Build

### Small, verifiable steps

Every source converges here. Osmani: "LLMs do best when given focused prompts — implement one function, fix one bug, add one feature at a time." Anthropic's harness research: agents that try to do too much at once fail. CodeScene: smaller changes in healthy code produce fewer defects.

The practical heuristic: **if you can't verify a change in under two minutes, break it smaller.**

This also protects you from the most expensive failure mode — the agent builds something large, you don't verify along the way, and you discover at the end that the foundation was wrong. Small steps make wrong turns cheap.

### Plan when choices matter, just build when they don't

Most builders either never use plan mode (and waste time on wrong approaches) or always use plan mode (and waste time planning things that should just be done).

The heuristic: **use plan mode when there are multiple reasonable approaches and the wrong choice would be expensive to reverse.** "Fix the typo on line 42" doesn't need a plan. "Add authentication" needs alignment on the approach before code starts.

Osmani's workflow makes this explicit: Explore → Plan → Code → Commit. But the Explore and Plan steps scale with the ambiguity of the task. A clear, scoped task can skip straight to Code.

### TDD works better with agents, not worse

Willison advocates TDD specifically adapted for agent workflows. The pattern:

1. Write the test (or have the agent write it from your spec)
2. Verify the test captures the behavior you actually want
3. Let the agent implement until the test passes
4. Review the implementation

This works better with agents for a specific reason: **the test is an unambiguous, machine-checkable definition of "done."** Without a test, "done" is the agent's judgment — and Anthropic's research shows agents reliably skew positive when evaluating their own work. With a test, "done" is a pass/fail that neither side can talk their way around.

Write tests that verify **behavior**, not implementation details. Tests written to hit a coverage number are paperwork. Tests that describe what the system should do from the outside are specifications.

### Build complete, not fast

When requirements come from real experience — months of validation, caught bugs, proven workflows — they aren't hypothetical. They're the spec. Build them complete.

The anti-pattern: agents (and some methodologies) will suggest trimming scope to a "minimal" version. This is appropriate when you're exploring an unknown problem space. It's inappropriate when you know exactly what's needed and the requirements are the distilled result of real-world use.

Build each feature completely — with error handling, edge cases, tests, documentation. "We'll polish it later" is a fiction. The polish phase never arrives. Ship the feature done or don't ship it.

### Commit as checkpoints

Commits aren't ceremony. They're save points.

- **Commit after each working step** — before asking the agent to make the next change
- **Meaningful messages** — "feat: add user authentication with JWT" tells you what to revert to. "WIP" tells you nothing.
- **One logical change per commit** — a commit that mixes a feature, a refactor, and a bug fix is three commits that can't be independently reverted
- **The body says what the change does and why**, in two or three sentences. It is not the place for the defect hunt, the review findings, or the build narrative. A reader six months from now needs the decision, not the story.

---

## 6. Working Together

### Give full errors, not summaries

When something fails, paste the full error message and stack trace. Don't say "it didn't work" or "there's an error." The single biggest time-waster in agent sessions is vague error descriptions that force the agent to guess at what went wrong.

The agent can process a 50-line stack trace in milliseconds. You summarizing it to one sentence loses the diagnostic signal.

### Feedback shapes future behavior

When the agent does something wrong, say **why**, not just "no." When it does something right in a non-obvious way, say so — validated approaches are as important to capture as corrections.

Specific, directional feedback: "Don't add a try/catch here — this function should let errors propagate to the caller because the caller has the context to handle them meaningfully."

Vague feedback: "That's wrong." (Forces the agent to guess what's wrong and why.)

If you find yourself giving the same feedback twice, put it in your operating manual. The correction should persist, not repeat.

### When to review closely vs. trust

Not every line needs the same scrutiny. Calibrate your review to the risk:

- **New territory** (unfamiliar library, security-sensitive code, complex business logic) — review every line
- **Established patterns** (another CRUD endpoint matching five existing ones) — spot-check
- **Pure boilerplate** (test scaffolding, import reordering, formatting) — skim

The calibration should shift over a project's lifetime: tight review early (while patterns are being established) → relaxed in the middle (patterns are proven) → tight again when entering new territory.

The one constant: **always review the diff, never just the agent's summary.** The summary describes intent. The diff describes reality. They diverge more often than you'd expect.

### Show, don't tell

When you want the agent to follow a pattern, pointing at an existing example in the codebase is 10x more effective than describing the pattern in prose.

"Follow the pattern in `src/api/users.ts`" beats a paragraph explaining the API pattern. The agent will read the file, internalize the structure, and replicate it. This works because agents are excellent pattern matchers — showing them a concrete example is playing to their strength.

### Stop before anything irreversible or outward-facing

Most agent work is reversible: a bad edit is a `git checkout` away. Some is not. Publishing, deleting data, force-pushing shared branches, signing, writing to a public log, sending to an external service, spending money. For those, the rule is flag the risk, stop, and get the human's call before acting, even when the action follows from the task.

A concrete case: a keyless signing setup would, by default, have written private organization and repository names into a public transparency log. The agent flagged it before running it. The pause surfaced a staging option that the default path never mentioned. The risk was not in the code. It was in a default the agent could see and the human had not thought about.

Encode the boundary in the operating manual as a short list of action types that always stop. Generic caution on everything trains the human to say "yes" without reading. A short list of real stops keeps each one meaningful.

### Don't accumulate decisions in conversation

If something important is decided — an architectural approach, a naming convention, a scope boundary — put it in a file. Conversation context gets compressed, summarized, or lost across sessions. Files are permanent.

The agent can always re-read a file. It can't always recall a decision from 50 messages ago, especially across session boundaries. If a decision matters tomorrow, write it down today.

---

## 7. Quality and Verification

### Absence of evidence never renders as success

This is the one sentence the rest of this section depends on. An agent asked whether its work is done will say yes. A tool whose detector did not run will report zero findings. A check that was skipped produces the same silence as a check that passed. In every case the honest state is "unknown", and unknown must never display as green.

Give every result an explicit state, and make only one of them a pass: verified (with evidence attached), unknown (nothing checked it), incomplete, blocked, failed, stale (the evidence is older than the code), or not applicable. A report, a dashboard, a PR comment, or an agent's summary that collapses any of those into a pass is a false pass, and a false pass is worse than a failure because nobody looks at it.

This applies to your own tooling too. One builder's efficiency monitor reported zero interventions for weeks. The detectors were not quiet; a settings file had disabled the plugin and two components were writing to different databases. Zero looked exactly like success. Instrument the instrument: a tool that reports on quality must also report when it could not observe anything.

### Automated gates are force multipliers

CodeScene's peer-reviewed research (39 production codebases) found that **healthy code enables 124% faster development and contains 15x fewer defects.** When AI agents operate on unhealthy code, defect risk increases by at least 60%. Agents need code health above 9.4/10 to keep bug rates in check; the industry average is 5.15.

What this means in practice: **invest in your automated quality pipeline before investing in agent sophistication.** Tests, linters, type checkers, and formatters provide backpressure that catches agent mistakes automatically. The loop becomes: agent writes code → automated tools catch issues → agent fixes them → you oversee the direction.

Osmani describes this as "having an extremely fast junior dev whose work is instantly checked by a tireless QA engineer."

### Separate who builds from who evaluates

Anthropic's harness research found a critical pattern: **agents reliably praise their own work**, even when quality is mediocre. Without a separate evaluation signal, you get agents that ship at 30% complete with full confidence.

Practical applications:

- **Code review**: the agent that wrote the code should not be the sole reviewer. Use a separate review pass — whether that's a different agent, a code review bot, or your own eyes on the diff.
- **Test evaluation**: if the agent wrote both the code and the tests, verify the tests actually test something meaningful. Tests written to make the suite pass are paperwork.
- **Completion assessment**: don't ask the agent "are you done?" It will say yes. Define done as observable criteria (tests pass, feature works in the browser, deployment succeeds) and check those criteria yourself.

### Live verification is the definition of done

Type checking and test suites verify code correctness. They do not verify feature correctness. A feature is done when you've seen it work — in a browser, in a terminal, against real data.

This is the gap where the most bugs hide: code that passes all tests but doesn't actually do what the user needs. The agent can't close this gap for you. You have to use the thing.

### Mutation-test the tests

A test that passes proves little until you know it can fail. For every guard, check, or honesty invariant that matters, remove or invert it and confirm that exactly its own tests go red and nothing else does. Then restore it. The transcript of that red-then-green is stronger evidence than the green alone, and it belongs in the PR.

This matters more with agents than without. Agents write tests that pass. Some of those tests assert the implementation back at itself, or stub the very path they claim to cover. A mutation check separates tests that are load-bearing from tests that are paperwork, and it takes a minute per guard.

### Check your fakes against the real dependency

A test double encodes a belief about how the real thing behaves. If the belief is wrong, every test built on the double is wrong in the same direction, and so is every reviewer who trusts those tests.

One team shipped a readiness fix whose tests modelled a browser event as blocking until the network settled. In the real browser the event resolves in a few milliseconds. The builder, the reviewer, and the shared fake all agreed the fix worked, and it did nothing. A reviewer required to run the real browser caught it. Before a fake counts as proof, verify its behavior against the real dependency's documentation or a live probe, and record which one you used.

### Coverage honesty

"Found nothing" is not the same as "didn't look." When running quality checks:

- **Full coverage**: all expected checks ran and completed
- **Partial**: some checks ran, gaps are identified
- **Degraded**: checks failed to run, coverage gaps explain what wasn't checked

A clean report with degraded coverage is less trustworthy than a report with findings but full coverage. Track what you checked, not just what you found.

### Match proof to the claim

Different claims require different proof. A unit test can prove a parser. It cannot prove a deployment. A browser test can prove a user path. It cannot prove the product is safe.

Use the strongest practical proof for the claim being made:

| Claim type | Minimum proof |
|---|---|
| Code behavior | Unit, integration, contract, or property tests at the behavior boundary |
| UI behavior | Browser test or live ridealong on the real route and viewport |
| Deployment | Live URL, release command output, or platform deployment record |
| Repository state | `git status`, `git log`, branch, remote, and hosting metadata |
| Account or identity state | Active CLI account, git author config, and remote access check |
| External fact | Current primary source or official documentation |
| Product claim | Named scenario, deterministic proof, and live or realistic evidence when applicable |

For products with public, sales, safety, or architecture claims, keep a small claims proof matrix:

```
Claim:
Status: open | implemented | proved | live-validated
Automated proof:
Live / realistic evidence:
Limitations and gaps:
```

If the proof is weaker than the prose, weaken the prose. Honest "not yet" sections are better than confident claims the product cannot defend.

## 8. Scaling Across Sessions

### The session continuity problem

Anthropic's harness research names this directly: "The core challenge of long-running agents is that they must work in discrete sessions, and each new session begins with no memory of what came before."

Every session start is a cold start. The agent doesn't remember what you discussed yesterday, what approach you agreed on, or what's half-finished. Without a bridging mechanism, you waste the first 10 minutes of every session re-establishing context — or worse, the agent proceeds from stale assumptions.

### Structured artifacts bridge sessions

Anthropic's solution: a progress file alongside git history. The agent reads the progress file, checks recent git log, and understands current state without being told.

The general principle: **anything the agent needs to know across sessions should be in a file, not in your memory.** This includes:

- Current state of work (what's done, what's in progress, what's next)
- Decisions made and why
- Known issues and workarounds
- The operating manual (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md) itself

When signals disagree, use an authority order. A good default:

1. Current user instruction
2. Current code, tests, and repo-owned docs
3. Git state, PRs, issues, and deployment records
4. Explicit handoff or progress files
5. Tool memory and old conversation summaries
6. Terminal transcripts and stale command output

Memory is a hint, not authority. Old terminal output is especially dangerous because it looks concrete even when it describes a state that no longer exists.

### Update state with the code

Progress files drift unless they move with the implementation. When a slice changes current state, update the state or progress artifact in the same commit as the code whenever practical.

A strong handoff is a green commit that carries its own truth: code, tests, state, and any locked decisions. A separate note written later can be useful, but it is weaker evidence than a commit that updates the product and its current-state document together.

### Docs in the repo, not in conversation

For multi-session projects, write reference documentation in the repo before building. Context windows compress and sessions end. A spec that exists only in conversation will be lost or distorted.

Chunked docs in the repo enable progressive disclosure — load only what's needed for the current task, not the entire project history. This matters more as projects grow: a 20-file project can fit in context, a 200-file project cannot.

### Re-orient before acting

Every session should start with orientation: read the current state, check what's changed, verify the baseline still works. Anthropic's harness architecture makes this explicit — every session follows: **Orient** (read progress, task list, recent git history) → **Verify baseline** (test that existing functionality still works) → **Build** (implement the next thing).

Skipping orientation is how you get an agent that "fixes" something that was already working, or builds on top of a broken foundation from the previous session.

### A plan in execution is frozen

When one session is executing a plan, no other session edits that plan. New scope, new findings, or a better idea go in a new file that names the plan it extends and why. The executing session reads the new file at its next checkpoint.

The failure this prevents is quiet and expensive: an architect session improves a plan while a builder is halfway through the old version, and the builder's next step no longer matches the document it was briefed from. "I am working on that plan" is a freeze signal. Treat it as one.

### Keep one rolling plan, and automate the trigger

A state file records where you are. It does not, by itself, keep you on course toward where you are going. On long builds the forward plan tends to scatter across half-current documents or live only in the builder's head, and re-planning happens only when someone remembers to do it -- which, across enough sessions, they don't. The result is drift: each session re-derives the goal from partial memory and slowly wanders.

Two practices fix this:

- **One current plan, rolling-wave.** Keep exactly one plan that runs from now to done. Detail the next step, sketch the rest, and regenerate it at each checkpoint as the near becomes now. This is standard rolling-wave planning -- the far end is allowed to be coarse. Keep one in flight: when a plan is superseded, move the old copy to a "previous" archive instead of deleting it. Previous, not stale -- history is fuel for progressive disclosure, but only one plan is ever current. The discipline that prevents drift is having exactly one document that answers "where are we going," not many that half-do.

- **Automate the trigger; do not rely on discipline.** Orienting and updating state happen reliably only when something other than memory triggers them. Surface the current plan automatically at session start -- for example, a session-start hook that prints it -- so the agent reads it instead of re-deriving. And attach the replan to an event that already happens: the green commit or merge that closes a slice. Bolting "regenerate the plan" onto an existing habit (habit-stacking) is what makes it recur, where a free-floating reminder decays.

The method here -- rolling-wave planning, limiting work-in-progress to one plan, habit-stacking the replan onto the commit -- is established practice. The failure mode is treating staying-on-track as something you remember to do, rather than something the environment makes happen.

---

## 9. Working with Multiple Agents

As projects grow, you'll use multiple agents — a builder, a reviewer, parallel investigators, specialized subagents. These patterns, drawn from multi-agent production work and Anthropic's harness research, help you coordinate them.

### Builder/reviewer separation

The agent that wrote the code should not be the sole evaluator of the code. This is Anthropic's most consistent finding: agents reliably praise their own work. The fix is structural, not prompting — use a separate context, separate prompt, and separate evaluation criteria for review.

The cycle: **build** (agent implements a slice) → **self-test** (agent runs tests) → **review** (different agent or human reviews the diff against the spec) → **human stop** (you decide whether to continue).

### Two-stage review, and match the model to the task

When a separate agent reviews, split the review into two passes, in order: **spec-compliance first** (did it build what was asked — nothing missing, nothing extra?), then **code-quality** (is what it built well-made?). Running quality review before spec-compliance wastes effort polishing the wrong thing. Each finding goes back to the *same* implementer to fix, then the reviewer re-checks — don't move on with an open finding, and don't let the implementer's self-review stand in for the separate review.

Match the model to the task to control cost without losing rigor: a cheap, fast model for mechanical, fully-specified work (one file, complete spec); a standard model for integration and judgment (multiple files, pattern-matching, debugging); the most capable model for design and review. Most well-specified implementation is mechanical — spend the capable model where a second set of eyes pays off, on the review and the architecture, not the transcription.

### Verify the builder's report against the repository

A builder's report is a claim. "Committed as `2af13b7`, tree clean, 19 ahead" is exactly as true as the repository says it is, and no truer. On one project that report was false: the hash did not exist, the work was uncommitted, and the gates and an external review had already started against a HEAD that did not contain it.

After every builder hand-back, and before any gate, review, or push, read the repository yourself: `git log`, `git status`, and `git reflog` when a hash looks wrong. It takes seconds. Trusting the report instead costs a review cycle at best and a merge of nothing at worst.

### Two-phase briefs: audit and failing test first

For any packet where the premise might be wrong, split the brief. Phase one: audit the current behavior, write the failing test that captures the intended change, and stop. The architect reads the audit and the red test, and ratifies or corrects the premise. Phase two: implement until green.

The stop is the point. Two of the first several two-phase briefs on one project revealed a wrong premise before a line of implementation existed. A single-phase brief would have built the wrong thing correctly, and the review would have had to catch it in a diff instead of a paragraph.

### Fresh context per batch, bounded review cadence

Long-lived builder sessions degrade. Context fills with history, instructions thin, and the agent's reports drift from the repository. One builder kept alive across four fix rounds reached roughly 425,000 tokens of history and misreported its commits twice, while the reviewer spent roughly 563,000 tokens re-reviewing each round.

The cadence that came out of it: a fresh builder with a cold brief for each sub-batch of work; one independent review per sub-batch; fix rounds get the architect's review and the automated gates, not another full external review. Cap concurrent builders at what you can actually review as the work comes back. On an eight-core machine that was two.

### Design agent roles from real professions

When you need a roster of agent roles for a domain, research how humans in that domain actually organize before inventing one. A made-up roster feels plausible and is usually wrong in ways that cost later: authority flows the wrong direction, two roles overlap, a real role is missing.

One project needed a creative review structure. The first roster was invented and read well. Research found that the pairing it proposed had existed in advertising since 1949 under different names, and that the review panel it proposed copied a well-known studio practice with the authority reversed. The researched version worked. Name the sources in the role document so the next person can check them.

### Narrow review scopes

Broad review prompts ("review the whole codebase") time out or produce shallow results on any non-trivial project. Each review should name the exact changed files, the spec they should match, and the specific concerns to check.

Good: "Review the diff in `src/auth.py` and `tests/test_auth.py` against the JWT spec in the design doc."

Bad: "Review all the changes and make sure everything looks good."

### Human stop points

Without explicit stops between slices, agents chain work indefinitely. Each chained step inherits and amplifies any drift from the plan. Build natural stopping points where you evaluate direction, not just correctness.

The stop isn't "does the code work?" — it's "is this still building toward what I want?"

### AI can veto but cannot approve

Agents can reject work that fails invariants — a test suite, a linter, a security check. But final approval to merge and ship requires human judgment. This is the authority boundary: agents enforce constraints, humans make acceptance decisions.

### Drafts vs. canonical artifacts

When agents produce work products (not just code — reports, analyses, decisions), treat them as drafts until a human or policy engine promotes them. The boundary should be structural, not just social: agent output is labeled as draft, and promotion to canonical status is a separate, auditable step.

Without this boundary, AI can effectively self-certify its own work. The draft/canonical split makes human review a part of the system, not just a good intention.

### Parallel investigation, not parallel implementation

Multiple agents investigating different hypotheses simultaneously (debugging, research, code archaeology) is a superpower. Multiple agents implementing code in parallel usually causes problems — merge conflicts, inconsistent patterns, duplicate work.

Use parallelism for divergent work (investigation). Use sequential work for convergent work (implementation).

### Real-time messages are not durable state

Broker messages, chat pings, terminal logs, and status updates are useful coordination signals. They wake people up and keep work moving. They are not the source of truth.

Important outcomes - task ownership, review decisions, approval, rejected findings, scope changes, blocked state, final completion - belong in durable artifacts: task files, PRs, issues, reviews, commits, or progress docs.

If a stale message and the repo disagree, trust the repo and correct the durable record.

## 10. Cost

### Measure total cost to an accepted outcome

The only cost that matters is the total cost to a verified and accepted result. Tokens saved while review, rework, or defects go up are not a saving. A cheap build that needs three review rounds costs more than an expensive build that passes once.

Apply the measure to every efficiency decision. Does a shorter brief lower total cost, or does it move the cost into review? Does skipping the second reviewer save tokens, or does it ship the defect the second reviewer would have caught? If you cannot answer with evidence, you do not yet know whether the change is efficient.

### Rules that came from numbers

These came from measured incidents rather than principle, and they generalize:

- **Fresh context per batch.** A long-lived builder is more expensive than a new one, because its history is loaded on every turn and its reports degrade (§9).
- **No fan-out without a cost estimate.** Multi-agent review workflows cost a great deal and often find less than one careful reviewer with a narrow scope. Launch them when you can say what they will find that a single reviewer would not, and what they will cost.
- **Load the minimum.** The architect loads the project guide, the one current plan, the current packet, and the files that packet touches. Everything else is loaded on demand. Progressive disclosure is cheaper than a full context on every turn.
- **Spend capability where a second pair of eyes changes the outcome.** Mechanical, fully specified work goes to a cheaper model behind strong tests. The most capable model goes to design and review (§9).
- **Cap concurrency at what you can review.** Builders that finish faster than you can verify them produce unreviewed work, which is the most expensive kind.

### Honest cost reporting

A tool or a report that claims an intervention saved money must show the comparison it is based on. Without matched tasks and a verified acceptance on both sides, the honest claim is "we observed X" and not "X caused Y". The same rule that keeps a product's claims inside its proof applies to claims about the method itself.

---

## 11. Anti-Patterns

These are specific failure modes observed across many projects. Each one is tempting, common, and expensive.

### The "just fix it" instinct

When something breaks, the instinct is to tell the agent "fix this error." The agent will apply a patch. The patch will address the symptom. The root cause will remain, and you'll see a different symptom ten minutes later.

**Instead:** investigate why it broke. Have the agent explain the error, trace the cause, and propose a fix that addresses the root. This takes three minutes longer and saves thirty.

### Rubber-stamping

Reading the agent's summary of what it did and saying "looks good." The summary describes intent. The code describes reality. Always read the diff.

This gets harder as you trust the agent more — which is when it matters most. The agent is most likely to introduce subtle bugs in areas you've stopped closely reviewing because "it always gets this right."

### One-shotting complex work

Asking the agent to build an entire feature, page, or system in one request. Anthropic's research documented this failure mode explicitly: agents given high-level prompts try to one-shot and produce incomplete, low-quality results.

**Instead:** break work into steps. Each step should be small enough to verify before moving to the next.

### Narrating instead of doing

"I'm going to read the file, then I'll check the tests, then I'll look at the configuration..." The agent (or you) spending time describing what will be done instead of doing it. Bias toward action.

### Suggesting easier alternatives when things get hard

When the agent hits infrastructure friction — a test that's hard to write, a configuration that's complex, a dependency that's difficult — it may suggest skipping it or doing something simpler. Often the hard thing is the right thing. Push through.

### Silent scope reduction

Cutting features, removing edge cases, or simplifying requirements without explicitly acknowledging the reduction. Deferral is fine — silence about it is not. If scope changes, say what changed and why. This applies to both you and the agent.

### Recommending on effort, not merit

Related to silent scope reduction, but about the *justification*: the agent (or you) steers toward the smaller or faster option and dresses it as discipline — "let's just get it green," "this is less code," "the more finishable version." Effort and size are real considerations, but they are not *merits*. A recommendation should stand on correctness, the product's actual bar, and genuine risk — not on being easier. When the words "land it green," "least code," or "more finishable" are carrying the argument, that's the smell: re-justify on merit, and if you are deferring scope, defer it openly.

### Over-engineering for hypothetical futures

Building abstractions, helpers, or frameworks for requirements that don't exist yet. Three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction. The right amount of complexity is what the task actually requires, not what it might someday need.

### Using the agent as a search engine

Don't ask "what does this function do?" when you can read it yourself in 30 seconds. Use the agent for synthesis (processing many files), implementation (generating code), investigation (tracing through a codebase), and transformation (refactoring) — things where the agent's ability to process in parallel provides real leverage. Simple lookups are faster with your own eyes.

### Not establishing patterns early

The first component, module, or API endpoint you build with the agent becomes the implicit template for everything that follows. If the first one is sloppy, everything downstream inherits that sloppiness. Make the first one excellent. Every subsequent one will follow its shape.

### Ignoring the agent's pushback

When the agent says "this approach has a problem," evaluate it on its merits. The agent isn't being difficult — it may have caught something you missed. Dismissing pushback because you want to move fast is how design mistakes get baked in.

The flip side: when the agent pushes back with generic caution ("are you sure you want to..."), that's not the same as specific technical pushback. Generic caution can be overridden. Specific warnings should be investigated.

### Narrating a recovery that did not happen

When a gate was skipped, a reviewer timed out, or the bar slipped, the honest response is to name it, restore the gate, and continue. The dishonest response is prose that describes the recovery in the past tense while the gate is still down. Agents are good at the second one, and so are tired humans. If the log says "re-verified", the re-verification must exist.

### Reading silence as success

Zero findings, zero interventions, zero failures. Before celebrating, ask whether the detector ran. A monitor whose hooks are disabled, a test suite that discovered no tests, a linter pointed at an empty directory: all of them report clean. See the lead principle of §7.

### Letting claims outrun proof

Agents are good at making product language sound complete. That creates a subtle failure mode: the README, launch post, or architecture doc claims the thing you intended to build, while the code only proves a narrower slice.

**Instead:** keep claim boundaries explicit. Say what is proved, what is implemented but unproved, what is live-validated, and what is still not yet. A smaller honest claim beats a larger theatrical one.

## 12. The Practices at a Glance

A one-page reference for the practices in this guide, ordered by when they matter.

### Before you start
- [ ] Write your operating manual (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md) — concise, specific, context over rules
- [ ] Encode security as specific constraints, not principles
- [ ] Set up automated quality gates (tests, linter, type checker, formatter)
- [ ] Establish git workflow (branch per feature, conventional commits)

### Before you decide what to build (a strategy or design pass)
- [ ] Define the pass first — its question, the output that counts as done, what's out of scope
- [ ] Agent sharpens and stress-tests the thesis; it doesn't just agree
- [ ] Verify competitor / strategy claims against primary sources before building on them
- [ ] When you keep colliding on *how* to build, stop and sync the operating model explicitly

### Before each feature
- [ ] Write a work packet — goal, behavior, files, out of scope, checks, stop point, rollback
- [ ] Design verification alongside the feature, not after
- [ ] Plan when choices matter, just build when they don't
- [ ] If multi-session: write reference docs in the repo, not in conversation

### During the build
- [ ] Small, verifiable steps — verify each before moving on
- [ ] TDD: write the test, verify it captures intent, let the agent implement
- [ ] Commit after each working step — commits are save points
- [ ] Give full errors, not summaries
- [ ] Show examples, don't describe patterns
- [ ] Put decisions in files, not conversation
- [ ] Treat untrusted external text as evidence, never instruction
- [ ] Build complete — no placeholder anything
- [ ] Commit bodies say what changed and why, never the build narrative
- [ ] Flag and stop before anything irreversible or outward-facing

### After each step
- [ ] Review the diff, not the summary
- [ ] Run the feature yourself — type checks verify code, not features
- [ ] Match proof to claim — tests, browser, live URL, repo state, or proof matrix as appropriate
- [ ] Separate who builds from who evaluates
- [ ] Mutation-test the guards that matter: remove, confirm red, restore
- [ ] Verify every fake against the real dependency before its tests count as proof
- [ ] Update progress or state artifacts with the code when state changes
- [ ] At a checkpoint, regenerate the single current plan and archive the previous one
- [ ] Never edit a plan another session is executing; extend it in a new file

### When using multiple agents
- [ ] Separate who builds from who reviews — different context, different prompt
- [ ] Narrow review scopes — name exact files and spec, not "review everything"
- [ ] Build in human stop points between slices
- [ ] AI enforces constraints; humans make acceptance decisions
- [ ] Put important outcomes in durable artifacts, not broker or chat messages
- [ ] Use parallel agents for investigation, sequential for implementation
- [ ] Read git log and status yourself after every builder report
- [ ] Fresh builder per sub-batch; one independent review per sub-batch
- [ ] Two-phase briefs when the premise might be wrong: audit and red test, then ratify
- [ ] Cap concurrent builders at what you can review
- [ ] Research real professions before inventing an agent roster

### When deciding what it cost
- [ ] Measure total cost to a verified, accepted outcome, never tokens alone
- [ ] No multi-agent fan-out without a stated purpose and a cost estimate
- [ ] Report observed effects as observations; claim causes only with a matched comparison

### Every session start
- [ ] Read the one current rolling plan (surface it automatically; don't re-derive it)
- [ ] Orient: read progress, task list, recent git history
- [ ] Establish the current authority order — repo, docs, and git before memory or stale output
- [ ] Verify baseline: confirm existing functionality still works
- [ ] Then build

## Worked Example: One Slice, End to End

*Anonymized from a real session — a deterministic developer-tooling product. It threads the practices together in sequence; the specifics are scrubbed.*

**Deciding what to build (§3).** The session opened with a vague intent: "do it better than the incumbent." Undefined, that wanders. We **defined the pass first** — its question ("what makes us the obvious choice for this buyer, and what must we build to make it true?"), its output (a one-paragraph positioning lead plus a ranked list of product moves), and what was out of scope (pricing, go-to-market). Then we ran it: the human thought out loud toward a thesis; the agent's job was to **sharpen and stress-test it**, not agree — naming the strongest counter-argument, and conceding when the human's timing argument turned out to be the better one. A competitor claim the whole strategy leaned on was **verified against the incumbent's own materials before** we built on it (claims outrun proof in strategy too).

**Spec before code (§4).** The chosen slice got a short design doc — what it does, which files, how to verify, what it explicitly does not do — reviewed and approved before any implementation.

**The build, via subagents (§5, §9).** The plan was broken into small, test-first tasks. Each ran as a fresh subagent: write the failing test, implement, run the gates, commit. After each, **two-stage review** by separate agents — spec-compliance first (did it build exactly what was asked?), then code-quality. Models were **matched to the task**: a cheap model for the mechanical, fully-specified modules; a stronger one for integration; the most capable for the final whole-change review.

**What the separation caught.** The keystone moment: every per-task review passed, but the **final whole-change review caught a silent failure the per-task reviews structurally could not see** — a value that should have degraded to "unknown" was instead being reported as "all clear" in one cross-cutting configuration. A false all-clear was exactly the failure the product exists to prevent. It was caught *before merge*, fixed, and re-verified. Builder/reviewer separation (§9) earning its cost in one stroke.

**The operating-model sync (§3).** Midway, the human and agent kept colliding — the agent repeatedly recommending the smaller, faster option; the human repeatedly correcting it. Instead of re-litigating each instance, we **stopped and named the rule**: build to the bar; sequencing work for later is fine, but cutting scope to save effort is not; recommend on merit, never on "let's just get it green." Written down, the friction stopped.

**Finishing (§7, §8).** Done meant green — full suite, linters, types — verified by the human's own eyes on the diff, not the agent's summary. State files and the one rolling plan were updated in the same arc, and the work merged on green.

The whole session is just the manual's practices in sequence. None of it was improvised; all of it was the method.

## Case Study: Two Ways to Build the Same Product

*From the public build record of usabl, an accessibility proof engine. The method docs are linked at the end of this section. Where the lesson is specific to that product it is labeled as such.*

There is no one way to build with agents. The same product, under the same owner and the same quality bar, was built two different ways in two consecutive releases. Both worked. The parts that stayed fixed are the parts worth copying.

### What never flexed

The team wrote down the invariants before the first line of code and pasted them into every dispatch:

- One component is the only verdict authority. Everything else returns drafts.
- A passing result and its receipt are reserved for deterministic evidence. Preview and model judgment can surface findings but can never mint a pass.
- An unbuilt path fails honestly or stays unwired. No placeholder returns success.
- Text taken from the thing under test is untrusted and is neutralized at every output.
- Test first. Tests assert behavior. A reviewer pass after every unit of work. A security review before every merge.
- The orchestrating session does not write product code and does not rubber-stamp.

The product-specific invariants (verdicts, receipts) are the shape of a proof engine. The last three apply anywhere.

### Method one: phased build, four roles, three vendors

The first release followed a plan set written before any code: thesis and positioning, one consolidated design document, a dated decisions file that closed the design's open forks, then numbered implementation plans. Only then did building start.

Four roles ran on models from three different vendors. The human founder owned product, UX, and every push and merge. An architect session owned the design, the slice map, the briefs, and enforcement of the bar, and wrote no product code. One vendor's model implemented, test first, one task at a time. A second vendor's model reviewed after every task as both senior engineer and engineering manager, with "needs fixes" as the answer to any patch that matched the spec but was not senior work. A third vendor's model reviewed every pull request against main for security, independent of the code reviewer, and a green CI run plus an approved code review did not skip it.

Work shipped as coherence slices: one pull request per idea a reader can hold in a sentence, not one per task and not one per phase. Lessons the team kept from this method:

- A slice is a PR. A task is not. Fifteen task commits on a working branch became three PRs a reviewer could read.
- Stacked PRs plus squash merges rewrite branch history for every other clone. The second release did not stack.
- A code comment that cites a plan section rots. A comment that states the invariant does not.
- A merge gate that CI cannot enforce (a free-tier repository could not require the check) is recorded as a known gap and shown to the owner, never papered over.

### Method two: builder-reviewer loop, one environment, one vendor

The second release was a finish to team-pickup readiness, and it was built differently. Everything ran in one environment under one orchestrating session. For each slice, a builder agent built test first, a reviewer agent reviewed, and the loop repeated until the reviewer was satisfied. Then a separate security lane reviewed the slice, at slice granularity rather than per PR, so a four-slice feature that shipped as one PR got four security reviews. Pull requests on ordinary paths were pre-authorized and reviewed as they opened; changes to guarded paths and the release tag required explicit human approval.

Independence came from separate dispatches and adversarial framing rather than from different vendors. The record shows that was enough to catch real defects:

- On one slice, five review lanes ran at once. Three returned the same shape of finding: a confident wrong success, where recognition failed toward "already done" (a commented-out line read as wired, a substring match rewrote an operator's unrelated command, a 404 of any kind read as "no protection"). The fix in every case was to recognize only exact, anchored, positively confirmed forms and let everything else fall to refuse or cannot-verify.
- Every honesty guard was mutation-tested: remove the guard, confirm exactly its own tests go red and nothing else. Reviewers re-derived the checks themselves rather than accept the claim.
- A security lane recorded, for the record, that its first pass had accepted a byte-exact "already wired" check and missed a placeholder embedded in the draft it was checking. On re-derivation it ran crafted inputs and confirmed every one fell to not-wired.
- The release-critical merge needed two-person control and the sole code owner was also the author. The tool refused. The situation was surfaced for a human decision, the branch ruleset was snapshotted, bypassed once, restored, and confirmed byte-identical, and the commit body records the override. The security model proving itself on the release path is a result, not a defect.
- Clean-clone onboarding was run by a background agent from fresh clones and took 109 seconds. Four of eight commands exited non-zero, each an honest refusal. The result was labeled agent-run, not human-confirmed.

### Keeping the bar as sessions get long

Both methods shared one document whose only job was to stop quality from sliding as context filled. Its premise: subagents start empty, so a forgotten paste is the default failure, not a surprise. Every builder and reviewer dispatch had to carry the scoring criteria, the roles one-liner, the honesty list, and pointers to the few files that mattered, never the whole plan set. A dispatch missing any of the first three was not a legal dispatch and was rewritten.

The document also named the decline signals: skipping a reviewer because "it is small", the orchestrator writing product code "just this once", a rubber stamp on a spec-matching shrug, briefs getting shorter while diffs get sloppier, the same Important finding shipped twice. The response to any of them was to name it to the owner, restore the gate, and continue, and never to narrate a recovery that did not happen.

### What generalizes

- Fix the invariants and the review structure first. Vendors, model lineups, and process shape can change between releases without the bar moving.
- Independence between builder and reviewer is structural. Separate context, separate prompt, adversarial framing. Different vendors add diversity but are not what makes the separation work.
- Match review granularity to risk, not to the PR boundary. A security review per slice caught what a review per PR would have averaged away.
- Recognition that fails toward success is a recurring defect class in any tool that reports state. Recognize only exact positive forms; everything else is "cannot verify".
- Write the quality bar as a document the orchestrator pastes, not a habit it remembers.
- Keep an append-only build log, dated, that records what became true and what is still not built. Do not rewrite it to look smoother than it was.
