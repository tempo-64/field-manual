# Checklists

Checkpoint checklists for the steps in [METHOD.md](METHOD.md). The one-page summary of the practices themselves is the last numbered section of [FIELD-MANUAL.md](FIELD-MANUAL.md).

## Session start

- [ ] Confirm repository and worktree.
- [ ] Read the project guide.
- [ ] Read the one current plan.
- [ ] Check branch, remote, identity, and local changes.
- [ ] Review recent commits and current issues.
- [ ] Run the smallest useful baseline check.
- [ ] Name the next bounded action.

## Product decision

- [ ] Product Director mode used when the direction was still open.
- [ ] Intent restated in product and user terms.
- [ ] Hidden contradiction or core insight named.
- [ ] Materially different directions considered.
- [ ] Recommendation includes its main cost and rejection evidence.
- [ ] Human questions are limited to material product decisions.
- [ ] Proposed, accepted, rejected, and open rules are distinct.
- [ ] Accepted rules translated into behavior, failure states, and proof.
- [ ] Strongest counterargument recorded.
- [ ] Cheapest decisive experiment defined.

Before the specification:

- [ ] Name the user and buyer.
- [ ] State the problem and substitute.
- [ ] Define the smallest complete journey.
- [ ] State why this should exist.
- [ ] Record the strongest counterargument.
- [ ] Define success and stop rules.
- [ ] Separate facts from hypotheses.

## Specification

- [ ] Define behavior and non-goals.
- [ ] Define inputs, outputs, and failure states.
- [ ] Define state ownership.
- [ ] Define security and privacy boundaries.
- [ ] Define UX and accessibility needs.
- [ ] Define migration and rollback.
- [ ] Define tests and proof.

## Work packet

- [ ] One result.
- [ ] Exact scope.
- [ ] Acceptance checks.
- [ ] Proof path.
- [ ] Risks and containment.
- [ ] Non-goals.
- [ ] Human stop point.
- [ ] Plan reviewed before build when risk warrants.

## Build

- [ ] Behavior test written or confirmed.
- [ ] Small complete implementation.
- [ ] Focused checks pass.
- [ ] Required broader suite passes.
- [ ] Diff inspected.
- [ ] Docs and proof updated.
- [ ] One logical commit.

## Debug

- [ ] Failure reproduced.
- [ ] Complete error read.
- [ ] Root cause found before the fix.
- [ ] Fix applied at the cause.
- [ ] Regression test added.
- [ ] Repeat-defect capture considered.

## Review

- [ ] Intended current revision confirmed.
- [ ] Product and spec compliance.
- [ ] Proof truth and missing coverage.
- [ ] Security and privacy.
- [ ] UX and accessibility.
- [ ] Architecture and operations.
- [ ] Code quality.
- [ ] Simplification.
- [ ] Explicit verdict and follow-up.

## Red team

- [ ] Missing input.
- [ ] Malformed input.
- [ ] Stale or partial input.
- [ ] Hostile external text.
- [ ] Timeout and dependency loss.
- [ ] Retry and concurrency.
- [ ] Path and command abuse.
- [ ] Wrong identity or repository.
- [ ] Stale proof.
- [ ] Self-approval path.
- [ ] Interface and backend disagreement.

## Release

- [ ] Exact branch, commit, remote, and identity.
- [ ] Full required suite.
- [ ] Live proof for live claims.
- [ ] Security and dependency review.
- [ ] Documentation and examples.
- [ ] Migration, backup, recovery, and rollback.
- [ ] Claims matrix current.
- [ ] Known limits recorded.
- [ ] Planning and internal artifacts excluded from what ships.
- [ ] Human release decision.
- [ ] Restart-ready handoff.

## Practice promotion

- [ ] Source and date recorded.
- [ ] Candidate is clear and bounded.
- [ ] Applicability and risks reviewed.
- [ ] Trial defined before results.
- [ ] Accepted outcomes measured.
- [ ] Human promotion recorded.
- [ ] Expiry and rollback defined.
- [ ] Context and maintenance cost included.
